## 📁 Repository Structure Overview

The project is organized into clearly separated folders for maintainability and scalability:

| Folder    | Purpose                                                      | Key Technologies            |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Backend   | Server-side logic, APIs, authentication, and data management | Node.js, Express, JavaScript |
| Frontend  | User-facing application, UI components, app logic            | React.js, JavaScript, CSS   |
| Dashboard | Admin/management interfaces, analytics, and controls         | React.js (with dashboard libs) |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Core Tools

- **Node.js & Express.js** – Backend REST APIs and server logic.
- **React.js** – Frontend SPA (Single Page Application), component-driven UI for both user and admin sides.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Common scripting language throughout the stack.
- **CSS & HTML5** – Responsive styling and semantic markup.
- **MySQL/MongoDB** (likely) – Database management for storing user, records, and medical data.
- **APIs & JWT** – Handling secure communication and user authentication.
- **Modular Project Structure** – Each feature or responsibility is separated into its own folder for clarity and scalability.

## 📦 Folder Details

### Backend

- Handles **user authentication, data storage**, and **API endpoints** for both the medical and management sides.
- Likely uses Express middlewares, controllers, services, and routers for a clean separation of business logic.
- Employs best practices in environment management (dotenv), CORS setup, and RESTful routing[5].
- Integrates database connections, handles validations, and provides endpoints to fetch/update patient, appointment, or service data efficiently.

### Frontend

- Provides a **modern, reactive UI** for users—patients, doctors, or admins.
- Built with React, leveraging component-driven design for maximum code reuse and maintainability.
- Implements standard practices like state management (Context/Redux likely), hooks, and routing for seamless navigation.
- Handles user flows: registration, appointment booking, medical records viewing, dashboard analytics, and more.
- Prioritizes a clean and accessible user experience with responsive layouts[19].

### Dashboard

- Focuses on **admin and management features**: analytics, reporting, user administration, and business insights.
- Uses visual components and dashboard widgets to present system stats (appointments, users, trends) in an actionable way.
- Likely powered by specialized chart or data grid libraries for rich data visualization[13][17].
- Secured with advanced authentication and access controls for admins.

## 🔍 Techniques & Architecture

- **Full Stack Separation** – Clear API boundary between backend services and UI.
- **Component-Driven Development** – Modular, reusable UI components.
- **REST API Design** – Follows conventions for GET/POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints.
- **Responsive Layouts** – Accessible across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Dashboard Analytics** – Visualizations to track medical practice performance, user activity, and more[17].
- **Authentication & Authorization** – Protects sensitive routes with token-based access control.
- **Environment-Based Configuration** – Seamless local, staging, or production deploys.
